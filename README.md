# transcrypto
The aim of this project was to develop a prediction model using a pre-trained Transformer neural network that can determine investor sentiment on the most traded cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, and whether the Bitcoin price is likely to move up or down as a result of that sentiment. The model name - Transcrypto - is a play on Transformer + cryptocurrency.
A cryptocurrency has no instrinsic value and its value is therefore mostly dictated by investor sentiment. I used Twitter tweets about Bitcoin as a proxy for investor sentiment, limiting those tweets to US origination, in the English language, and published on two specific months. I chose two of the most volatile months in Bitcoinâ€™s price prior to the study: February 2021, when the price spiked, and May 2021, when the price crashed.
