# transcrypto
The aim of this project was to develop a prediction model using a pre-trained Transformer neural network that can determine investor sentiment on the most traded cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, and whether the Bitcoin price is likely to move up or down as a result of that sentiment. The model name - Transcrypto - is a play on Transformer + cryptocurrency.

A cryptocurrency has no instrinsic value and its value is therefore mostly dictated by investor sentiment. I used Twitter tweets about Bitcoin as a proxy for investor sentiment, limiting those tweets to US origination, in the English language, and published on two specific months. I chose two of the most volatile months in Bitcoinâ€™s price prior to the study: February 2021, when the price spiked, and May 2021, when the price crashed. The dataset consisted of 3.4 million tweets in February and 5.2 million tweets in May.

The model found a strong correlation between daily investor sentiment (as reflected by Twitter tweets) and the Bitcoin price the following day, with a correlation coefficient of about 0.77. In other words, if sentiment was positive, the price would likely rise the next day, conversely, if sentiment was negative, the price would likely fall.
